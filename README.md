# UNO Memory Game
A memory matching game built with React. The game uses uno cards, and the player needs to match pairs by flipping them over. The players briefly see the cards before starting the game. It tracks the number of turns and congratulates the player when all cards are matched. The game also includes animations and is responsive across devices.

# What I learned

* Strengthened understanding of conditional rendering to update the user interface.
* Reinforced how to create animations and a responsive layout.
* How to keep track of state properly.
* How to handle user interactions using event listeners and pass functions as props.
